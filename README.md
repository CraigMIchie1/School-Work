# School-Work

This repository consists of sample projects I have done through my undergraduate program. 
You will find my projects from my two computational physics classes to portray my 
understanding of coding and how my understanding of coding and analytics of the results
have developed over the years

The order of projects completed goes: Phys 381: Assignments are in numerical order \n
                                      Phys 481: Assignments are in numerical order
                                      Physics Exercises 
                                      Monte Carlo Exercises
                                      Monte Carlo Bootstrapping

The Physics Exercises, Monte Carlo exercises and Monte Carlo bootstrapping projects were completed through my first semester of a Joint Masters program in Nuclear Physics through the Erasmus Mundus Program.
